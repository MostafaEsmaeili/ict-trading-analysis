# ICT Methodology — codifiable rules (single source of truth)
All times are **New York (America/New_York), DST-aware**; the financial day starts 00:00 NY.
Full detail + citations live in plan §2 / §2.5; the must-know parameters are below.

## Killzones (NY)
- Asian 19:00–00:00 (forms the Asian Range) · London Open 02:00–05:00 (highest odds of the day's
  high/low) · New York Open 07:00–09:00 (USD pairs; Silver Bullet 10:00–11:00) · London Close 10:00–12:00.
- Operator selects active killzones via `Ict:Scanning:ActiveKillzones` (default LondonOpen + NewYorkOpen).
- **Instrument-class split** (§2.5.7): FX uses NY 07:00–10:00 / London 02:00–05:00 / Close 10:00–11:00 /
  PM 13:30–16:00; index futures use AM 08:30–11:00. HARD no-trade lunch 12:00–13:00.

## Primitives
- Swing high/low = 2 lower-highs / higher-lows either side (3-candle definition).
- FVG (3-candle): bullish `c1.High < c3.Low`; bearish `c1.Low > c3.High`. Two-touch invalidation: a 3rd
  return into the gap voids it.
- Order block: last down-close before an up-move = bullish OB (key = its open, +1 tick / +3 pips FX;
  mean-threshold = 50% of OB body); mirror for bearish. A valid OB requires its associated FVG.
- Liquidity: buy-side above old/equal highs, sell-side below old/equal lows. Sweep = wick beyond a
  level then close back inside (vs a "run" = continuation through it).
- Displacement = energetic move creating an FVG; precondition for a valid MSS/entry (quantify the
  energy with a body/ATR filter — §2.5.7).
- MSS/CHoCH = break of a short-term swing AFTER a liquidity sweep.

## Entry / bias / risk
- OTE = fib retrace of the impulse leg, anchored body-to-body (wicks only FOMC/NFP): entry 0.62–0.79,
  sweet spot **0.705** (Primer-sourced default — confirm provenance), targets at 0 and negative
  extensions; also −1/−1.5/−2 SD projections. Equilibrium = 50%.
- Daily bias = discount(<50%)/premium(>50%) of the daily dealing range + draw-on-liquidity; neutral = no trade.
- Risk default **1%** with-bias (developing 0.25–0.5%, max 4.5%); loss-ladder 1%→0.5%→0.25%, restore
  after recovering 50% of the loss. Min RR ~2.5R (configurable default, not a hard transcript rule).

## THE mechanical entry model (mined from the 2022 Mentorship — plan §2.5)
**ICT 2022 Intraday FVG Model — Liquidity Sweep → MSS/Displacement → PD-Array OTE Entry.**
Confirm a setup ONLY when ALL of these hold (RequiredConditions):
1. **Bias** — daily one-sided: discount (<50% of daily range) = bullish, premium (>50%) = bearish; neutral = NO trade. Trade only with bias.
2. **Draw on liquidity** — a valid opposing target exists (relative-equal H/L, prior-day H/L, HTF FVG, big figures 00/20/50/80).
3. **Killzone** — inside an enabled window (FX: London Open 02:00–05:00, NY 07:00–10:00, London Close 10:00–11:00, PM 13:30–16:00; Index: AM 08:30–11:00). NEVER lunch 12:00–13:00.
4. **Liquidity sweep** — price raids a prior high/low AGAINST the trade direction (Judas vs midnight/08:30 open).
5. **MSS + displacement** — an energetic candle breaks a prior 3-candle swing and CLOSES beyond it (weak/wick = NO trade).
6. **FVG** — first 3-candle gap found 15m→1m within the displacement leg (none → NO trade), in the correct half: shorts ≥50%, longs ≤50%.
7. **Entry** — limit in the FVG/OB at OTE **62–79%** (sweet-spot 70.5%); OB entry = OB open +1 tick / +3 pips FX.
8. **Stop** — beyond swept swing / FVG / OB (1–2 ticks, ~10 pips FX); clear the farther of two stacked FVGs.
9. **Targets** — T1 nearest FVG/50%/short-term level (partial), T2 opposing liquidity / HTF draw; min RR ~2.5R (configurable). Trail 50%→25% risk, 75%→breakeven. Max hold 90–120 min, no overnight.

**Grade/alert gate (TGR-4):** score = Σmatched weights / Σapplicable ×100. A ≥80 (all required); **all-required auto-clears to B** — the bare-required 63 is NOT suppressed to C; Reject if any required missing. The 0–100 score is the within-grade sorter (the B/C thresholds are display labels). Only A/B alert. Weights & full detail in plan §2.5 + `docs/ict-core-model-decisions.md`.

**Caveats (verify medium-confidence, §2.5.7):** 70.5% sweet spot & Silver Bullet are Primer/canon, not grounded in these 2022 eps — keep configurable; FX vs index killzone windows are SEPARATE (instrument-class switch, default FX); ~2.5R is a default not a hard rule; quantify "displacement" with a body/ATR filter; detectors must emit FVG two-touch + ITH/ITL **invalidation**, not just formation.

## Web cross-check resolutions (plan §2.5.10 — transcripts stay PRIMARY)
On any web-vs-transcript conflict, the transcripts win. Keep these PRIMARY defaults: OTE fib **body-anchored**
(wicks only FOMC/NFP); min RR ~2.5R configurable (not 3); London Close **10:00–11:00**; lunch **12:00–13:00**;
targets = **−1/−1.5/−2 SD** (not negative-fib); Asian **19:00–00:00**; FX NY **07:00–10:00**. Adopt as
configurable additions: FVG validity exclusions (no-sweep / Asian / counter-bias / no-CHoCH / overlapping
wicks → reject), FVG mitigation + two-touch invalidation, ATR displacement filter, broken-swing-only fib
anchoring + array inversion on BOS, break-even-at-1R, portfolio risk cap ≈5%. Provenance-flag (configurable,
NOT Mentorship-verbatim): 70.5% sweet spot, Silver Bullet windows, PD-array 7-tier ranking, 25–75% quadrant.
Never hard-code community win-rate stats.

## Trade style & timeframe (plan §4.7)
A `TradeStyle` (Scalp/Intraday/Swing/Position) picks the timeframe triple (Bias/Structure/Entry) from the
ICT top-down cascade Daily→H1/H4→M15→M5/M3→M1. Default = **Intraday** (the §2.5 model). Config: `Ict:TradeStyles`
+ `Ict:Scanning:ActiveStyles`. Every Setup is tagged with its style + trigger timeframe.

## Time zone (plan §4.8)
ICT times are **New York** with US DST. UTC is the only stored truth; NY math goes ONLY through `NyClock`
(`America/New_York` via ICU — never the Windows `"Eastern Standard Time"`); never use the ambient host zone.

## Guardrail
Analysis + paper trading ONLY. Never propose or implement a live-order path.
